# Ciuf.app

## Project Management

Create a big issue for a complete feature (such as `Core API Proof of Concept`).
This is to be associated with the `ciuf-launch` and `ciuf-backend` projects

Create subissues and assign them only to the `ciuf-backend` project.

Define a Start and End date for each issue/sub-issue so we can keep track in the Gantt
